# ✅ Final Solution - Large Files Excluded

## What I Did

1. ✅ **Removed large model files** from git tracking
   - `checkpoints/` folder (417MB + 173MB files)
   - `exports/pytorch_model.bin` (417MB)
   - Total: ~1GB removed

2. ✅ **Updated .gitignore** to exclude:
   - All `*.bin` files
   - `checkpoints/` folder
   - `models/` folder

3. ✅ **Updated README.md** with instructions:
   - Models can be regenerated from the notebook
   - Models can be downloaded separately if needed

## 🚀 Push Status

The push command was executed. Check your repository:
**https://github.com/Feitaaann/Code_Trinity**

## ✅ What's in the Repository Now

- ✅ All code files
- ✅ All deliverables (docx, pptx, etc.)
- ✅ Notebooks
- ✅ Experiment logs
- ✅ README and documentation
- ❌ Large model files (excluded - can be regenerated)

## 📝 About Model Files

The large model files (`.bin` files >100MB) are excluded because:
- GitHub has a 100MB file size limit
- Files are 417MB and 173MB (too large)
- Models can be regenerated by running the notebook
- This is a common practice for ML repositories

## 🔄 To Get Model Files

1. **Run the notebook**: `Code_Trinity_Final_Project.ipynb` will train and save models
2. **Download separately**: If you need the pre-trained models, they can be shared via:
   - Google Drive
   - Dropbox
   - GitHub Releases (if under 100MB each)
   - Or any file sharing service

## ✅ Repository is Now Pushable

Without the large files, the repository should push successfully. The repository is now much smaller and all files are under GitHub's limits.

**Check your GitHub repository now!** All files (except large models) should be there.
