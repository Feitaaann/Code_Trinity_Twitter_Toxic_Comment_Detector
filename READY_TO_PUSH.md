Your large model files are now tracked with Git LFS:
- ✅ `checkpoints/bert-base/best/pytorch_model.bin` (417MB)
- ✅ `checkpoints/bert-base/best/pytorch_model_quantized.bin` (173MB)
- ✅ `exports/pytorch_model.bin` (417MB)

## 🚀 Push Everything Now

```powershell
cd "C:\Users\ASUS\Desktop\Elective 4\Code_Trinity"
git push -u origin main
```

4. **Don't cancel** - Let it complete even if it seems slow
